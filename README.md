# Wave Function Collapse Visualizer

This project demonstrates the concept of wave function collapse (WFC) using Python, along with visually illustrating how to pave a plane using a defined set of tiles.

## Description

The Wave Function Collapse algorithm is a method for generating patterns that satisfy a set of local constraints. It operates by selecting and collapsing wave functions based on neighboring tiles until a complete pattern emerges. This project provides a visual representation of this process, allowing users to observe how the algorithm evolves and how different constraints affect the final outcome.

## Features

- Generate patterns using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm.
- Visualize the evolution of the pattern generation process.
- Define custom tile sets and constraints.
- Interactive interface for exploring different configurations.
